## Favorite books read in 2019

2019 was the year of me reading books that took me on emotional rollercoasters.

* **On the Come Up by Angie Thomas** - Angie Thomas is the queen of modern YA. 

* **A Ladder to the Sky by John Boyne**- I think a lot of us dream about becoming novelists. Well, John Boyne is here to crush on your dreams and scare you away from that in the most terridying way. I've never hated and loved a book as much as this one. You're going to want to claw your eyes out because the Protagonist in this is terrible, but also... this book is just SO well written.

* **The Diviners by Libbra Bray** - Prohibition era fantasy that focuses on the "outsiders" of America. I used to think that books set in 20s would be boring, but honestly this is so vivid and the characters are full of personality and say "this is the cat's _meow_" unironically. 

* **The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid** - I was pretty much crying by chapter 2 so uhh... you're in for a wild ride.

* **Jade City by Fonda Lee** - This book perfectly captures the essence of _Legend of Korra_ all while infusing it with _Gangs of New York_ and it's BEAUTIFUL. Also, the author doesn't care about your emotions and WILL make your favorite characters go through the absolute worst. 

* **The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal** - Speculative fiction set around the Cold War. What if a huge meteor wiped out most of the US and now we have a few years to find a new planet before we DIE?
